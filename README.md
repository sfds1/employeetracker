## Technologies
Node, Javascript, MySQL

## Languages, frameworks, various tools
This application uses Node packages Inquirer, console.table and MySQL.

## Challenges
The basic design was not so bad, but I am trying to re-factor the code I have in the server.js to be cleaner.  That has been a challenege as there is lot to do with promises, async and wawait and contructor functions.  

## Your experience building this app
The hard part is trying to figure out how to refactor the code so I don't have to make the same calls but still show the data in a nice way

## What was difficult
Constructor functions

## What did you learn
I am still learning about constructor functions and how they deal with renaming column headers for viewing.


## How did you go about solving a problem
This time around I asked my tutor as I didn't have time to research other ways
